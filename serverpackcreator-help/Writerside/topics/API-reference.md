# Rest API Reference

This section provides documentation and simple examples for the REST API of ServerPackCreators webservice.

You are not bound to use the webservice with your browser. The frontend makes use of the REST API, and so can you.

That way, you can create scripts to automate server pack deployments from your own webservice-instance.

> There is no publicly available instance of ServerPackCreators webservice due to security concerns with the ability
> to upload zip-archives. If you want to make use of the webservice, you will have to host your own instance.

> The actual values returned may differ. They may contain more information or less. For example, more versions may be
> returned, or more modpacks, or more server packs.
