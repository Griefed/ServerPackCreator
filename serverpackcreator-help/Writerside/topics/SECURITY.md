# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only releases of the latest major-minor-release-line are supported.

For example, if the latest major-release-line is 4.1.x, then the following matrix would apply: 

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 4.1.x   | ✅         |
| 4.0.x   | ❌         |
| < 4.0   | ❌         |
| 3.x.x   | ❌         |
| 2.x.x   | ❌         |
| 1.x.x   | ❌         |

Similarly, if the latest major-minor-release-line is 5.3.x, then the following matrix would apply:

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 5.3.x   | ✅         |
| 5.0.x   | ❌         |
| < 5.0   | ❌         |
| 4.x.x   | ❌         |
| 3.x.x   | ❌         |
| 2.x.x   | ❌         |
| 1.x.x   | ❌         |

If a newer major-minor-line is released, keeping with the examples above, i.e. 4.2.x or 5.4.x, then the matrices above
should help you to determine which versions will receive security-updates.
