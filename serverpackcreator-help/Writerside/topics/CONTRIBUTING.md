# Contributing

## Building ServerPackCreator locally

Clone the webservice branch of the repository:

`git clone -b $BRANCH https://git.griefed.de/Griefed/ServerPackCreator.git`

Where `$BRANCH` represents the branch you want to clone.

If you are on linux, run `chmod +x gradlew` first.

Build with:

`build --info --full-stacktrace`

The `build` task is configured to do everything automatically, from installing frontend dependencies, assembling the web-frontend, copying some files around, build and testing.

If you wish to test the installer for your system, run `serverpackcreator-app:jpackage --info --full-stacktrace`. This
will generate the installer in the `serverpackcreator-app/build/dist`-directory.
Depending on your operating system, this may be either of:
- Windows: `ServerPackCreator-VERSION.exe`
- Ubuntu: `serverpackcreator_VERSION_ARCH.deb`
- MacOS: `ServerPackCreator-VERSION.dmg`
or other files. It depends on your operating system, really.

## Important info regarding pull requests, my GitLab instance, and GitHub!

If you want to contribute to ServerPackCreator, then the following procedure **must** be adhered to:

1. Fork ServerPackCreator
2. Create a new branch in your fork, following one of the following naming schemes:
   1. The end of each branch name bust be suffixed with a one-word description fitting the changes made. Examples:
      - griefed_chore_readme
      - griefed_perf_curseforgemodpack
      - griefed_feat_ziparchive
   2. For more details on what the naming scheme entails, see `.releaserc.yml` in the base directory of the repository or scroll down to the **Commits**-section.
   3. Schemes:
       1. your_username_breaking_
       2. your_username_build_
       3. your_username_chore_
       4. your_username_ci_
       5. your_username_docs_
       6. your_username_feat_
       7. your_username_fix_
       8. your_username_perf_
       9. your_username_refactor_
       10. your_username_revert_
       11. your_username_style_
       12. your_username_test_
       13. your_username_other_
3. Make your changes to your new branch:
    1. Try to keep the changes atomic, so they best fit the name of the branch.
    2. Follow conventional commit messages. See **Commits**-section for more details. Example:
        - feat: Allow upload of modpack-export zip-archive to web-frontend
        - refactor: Use apache commons-io for copying, instead of Files
4. Open an issue on the main repository, using the **Pull Request** template:
    1. Issue title: Your Username - Branch type (e.g. feat) - Short description of your changes. Example:
        - Griefed - feat - Allow upload of modpack-export zip-archive to web-frontend
    2. Issue description: Fill in the sections the template provide.
    3. Submit the new issue
5. I will then create a new branch in the main repository, with the same name as your branch, to which you will **then** create a pull request to.
6. If checks and tests pass, or any changes necessary have been made, the pull request is ready to be merged etc., I will merge it to your main repository branch.
7. I can then merge your main repository branch into main/master/whatever locally, push these changes to my GitLab instance, which will in turn push these changes to GitHub.
8. Done!

This is the only way to ensure that any changes made to ServerPackCreator always arrive on my GitLab instance first, then on GitHub.
Since I want to stay independent of GitHub and their architecture, I have to make use of my own GitLab installation. Hence this procedure. So, if one day, GitHub vanishes, we still can provide people with ServerPackCreator from my GitLab instance.

# Code

- **Config file:** If you want to contribute to SPC, please make sure you do not change the `serverpackcreator.conf`-file. Ideally, any version of SPC will work with any config file, as they all have the same content. Changing what's inside the `serverpackcreator.conf`-file may make versions incompatible to each other, but I want users to be able to simply download the newest version **without** having to migrate their config file or even worrying about such a thing.
Therefore, I ask that you do not touch the `serverpackcreator.conf`-file.

- **Variable names:** Please keep variable names verbose i.e. `thisStoresSomething` or `checkForStuff` or some such. Variables like `a` and `tmpA` make code harder to read. We're not aiming for best performance or whatever, so we can have longer variable names if we want to.

- **Access modifiers:** Because the files generated by this program are supposed to be distributed to multiple people, I try to keep methods and classes as closed-off as possible. It's not much, but it's something. Therefore, unless your method or class *absolutely* must be public, keep it package private or make it private completely. I reserve the right to refactor any such classes or methods.  

- **Translating:** If you wish to contribute to translating ServerPackCreator, have a look at the [resource bundles](https://github.com/Griefed/ServerPackCreator/tree/main/src/main/resources/de/griefed/resources/lang). Should you want to **add** a language to ServerPackCreator, add your locale in [LocalizationManager](https://github.com/Griefed/ServerPackCreator/blob/main/src/main/java/de/griefed/serverpackcreator/i18n/LocalizationManager.java), copy the [lang_en_us.properties](https://github.com/Griefed/ServerPackCreator/blob/main/src/main/resources/de/griefed/resources/lang/lang_en_us.properties) to lang_your_locale.properties and start translating!  

# Commits

If you want to contribute to SPC, please make sure your commits follow the conventional commit layout and use the types/categories/flags described here: [actions/auto-changelog](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/auto-changelog)

For completeness' sake:

```
type(category): description [flag]
```

The `type` must be one of the followings:

* `breaking` (Changes that break something makes something incompatible to earlier version)
* `build` (Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies)
* `ci` (Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts)
* `chore` (Other changes that don't modify src or test files)
* `docs` (Documentation only changes)
* `feat` (A new feature)
* `fix` (A bug fix)
* `other` (Other changes which don't fit the descriptions of the other commit types)
* `perf` (A code change that improves performance)
* `refactor` (A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature)
* `revert` (Reverts a previous commit)
* `style` (Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code)
* `test` (Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests)

> If the `type` is not found in the list, it'll be considered as `other`.

> The `category` is optional and can be anything of your choice.

> The `flag` is optional (if provided, it must be surrounded in square brackets) and can be one of the followings:

> `ignore` (Omits the commit from the changelog)

> If `flag` is not found in the list, it'll be ignored.
