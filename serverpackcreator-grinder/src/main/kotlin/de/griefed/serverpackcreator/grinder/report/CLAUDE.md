# grinder.report — verdict persistence and the web/CSV output

- **Persistence + web interface**: `JsonVerdictStore` (file-backed, loads on start, whole-file
  temp-then-atomic-move write, corrupt-file → empty) makes a multi-day run restart-safe.
  `VerdictReportRenderer` renders a **self-contained** HTML page — click-to-sort columns, an
  embedded-CSV download button, HTML-escaped cells **and** `\uXXXX`-escaped CSV-in-`<script>` so a
  mod-supplied `</script>` can't break out. `ReportServer` serves the table (`/`) and CSV
  (`/export.csv`) live off the store via the **JDK's built-in `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer`** —
  **no Spring, no new dependency**. *Deliberately standalone:* the report is self-contained rather than
  rendered through the app's Quasar frontend, because the grinder must not depend on `-app` (that would
  drag in Spring/Mongo/Swing and break its standalone nature).
