# serverpackcreator-grinder — module context

> Standalone fire-and-forget service that boot-verifies mods **at scale**, in **isolated, network-less
> Docker containers**, to accumulate a catalog-wide list of suspected-clientside mods. Package
> `de.griefed.serverpackcreator.grinder`. Depends on `serverpackcreator-clientside` (+ `-api`
> transitively) and **docker-java** (`docker-java-core` + `docker-java-transport-zerodep`, 3.7.1). No
> Spring, no Swing. Not published to Maven.

## Current state — the boot seam (container ServerRunner)

The reuse hinge is the clientside module's `ServerRunner` interface. The grinder implements it for
containers:

- **`ContainerServerRunner`** implements `clientside.ServerRunner` — boots a prepared pack in a
  container instead of a host process, so it slots into `BootVerifier` unchanged and feeds the same
  `BootLogClassifier` via `BootVerifier.outcomeFor`. Host-side staging (start-script check, write
  `eula.txt`, assemble the `ContainerSpec`) + mapping the engine's raw output onto `RunResult` live
  here, so it is unit-tested with a fake engine.
- **`ContainerEngine`** is the thin docker boundary (`ContainerSpec` → `ContainerRunOutput`), the same
  injectable-seam pattern as clientside's `HttpFetcher`. **`ContainerSpec` carries the untrusted-mod
  hardening as defaults**: `networkMode=none`, `readonlyRootfs`, `dropAllCapabilities`,
  `noNewPrivileges`, non-root `user`, tmpfs for `/tmp`, plus memory/cpu/pids caps. **Never mount the
  Docker socket into a boot container.**
- **`DockerJavaContainerEngine`** is the real docker-java impl (create → start → follow logs → stop →
  inspect exit → force-remove). **Not unit-tested** (needs a live daemon) — that is the whole reason
  the testable orchestration sits in `ContainerServerRunner` behind the seam. If you change it, verify
  against a real Docker daemon.

**Landmine — network vs. install:** the hardening default is `--network none`, but the *first* boot of
a given loader/MC needs network for the ServerStarterJar to download the loader + libraries. The plan
is to **pre-bake that once per `(loader, loaderVersion, minecraftVersion)`** into a cached, read-only
base tree (network only on the cache-miss), then every actual mod-boot mounts it and runs offline.
Don't wire the candidate-mod boot to run with network — that defeats the isolation.

## Testing

- `ContainerServerRunnerTest` uses a fake `ContainerEngine`: no-start.sh → `NotStarted` (engine never
  called), raw output → `RunResult.Completed`, and the assembled spec carries the hardening + pack
  mount + written eula. All offline.
- docker-java has no offline test double here; `DockerJavaContainerEngine` is integration-only.

## Still to build (the fire-and-forget service)

1. **`ContainerServerRunner` wired into a `BootVerifier`** via its `serverRunner` ctor param, against a
   built runtime image (JRE + ServerStarterJar + entrypoint).
2. **Pre-bake cache** keyed on `(loader, loaderVersion, minecraftVersion)`.
3. **Popularity-ranked work queue + bounded worker pool** (parallelism ≈ host-RAM / per-boot-memory),
   under a `SupervisorJob` so one worker dying doesn't sink the pool.
4. **Verdict store** (survives restarts) feeding the sortable / CSV-exportable table — render through
   the existing web frontend (QTable = sort + CSV free), not a new web stack.
