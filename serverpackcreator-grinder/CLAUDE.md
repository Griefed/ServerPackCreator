# serverpackcreator-grinder — module context

> Standalone fire-and-forget service that boot-verifies mods **at scale**, in **isolated, network-less
> Docker containers**, to accumulate a catalog-wide list of suspected-clientside mods. Package
> `de.griefed.serverpackcreator.grinder`. Depends on `serverpackcreator-clientside` (+ `-api`
> transitively) and **docker-java** (`docker-java-core` + `docker-java-transport-zerodep`, 3.7.1). No
> Spring, no Swing. Not published to Maven.

## Current state — the boot seam (container ServerRunner)

The reuse hinge is the clientside module's `ServerRunner` interface. The grinder implements it for
containers:

- **`ContainerServerRunner`** implements `clientside.ServerRunner` — boots a prepared pack in a
  container instead of a host process, so it slots into `BootVerifier` unchanged and feeds the same
  `BootLogClassifier` via `BootVerifier.outcomeFor`. Host-side staging (start-script check, write
  `eula.txt`, assemble the `ContainerSpec`) + mapping the engine's raw output onto `RunResult` live
  here, so it is unit-tested with a fake engine.
- **`ContainerEngine`** is the thin docker boundary (`ContainerSpec` → `ContainerRunOutput`), the same
  injectable-seam pattern as clientside's `HttpFetcher`. **`ContainerSpec` carries the untrusted-mod
  hardening as defaults**: `networkMode=none`, `readonlyRootfs`, `dropAllCapabilities`,
  `noNewPrivileges`, non-root `user`, tmpfs for `/tmp`, plus memory/cpu/pids caps. **Never mount the
  Docker socket into a boot container.**
- **`DockerJavaContainerEngine`** is the real docker-java impl (create → start → follow logs → stop →
  inspect exit → force-remove). **Not unit-tested** (needs a live daemon) — that is the whole reason
  the testable orchestration sits in `ContainerServerRunner` behind the seam. If you change it, verify
  against a real Docker daemon.
- **`LoaderCache`** — the pre-bake cache (the `--network none` enabler). `ensureInstalled(loader,
  loaderVersion, minecraftVersion)` returns a cached installed-server base, running a one-off
  `LoaderInstaller` (with network) only on a **miss**; **marker-gated** (`.spc-installed` written only
  after success, so a crash mid-install is redone, never served half-baked) and **serialized per
  tuple** so parallel workers share a single install. `LoaderInstaller` is the seam — its real impl (a
  setup container *with* network that snapshots the ServerStarterJar's self-install) is
  integration-only; everything else here is pure and unit-tested.
- **Orchestration** (`Grinder`, `GrindPool`, `VerdictStore`, `VerdictCsvExporter`): `Grinder.grind`
  verifies one candidate (skipping already-ground projects, *swallowing* a thrown boot so a bad mod
  can't sink a worker) via the `CandidateVerifier` seam and records one `GrindVerdict` per loader.
  `GrindPool.grindAll` drains a **popularity-ranked** batch across N worker threads (N ≈ host-RAM /
  per-boot-memory — each in-flight grind holds a booting container). `VerdictStore` (in-memory default)
  accumulates, keyed by `slug+loader` (re-verify replaces, not duplicates); `VerdictCsvExporter`
  renders RFC-4180 CSV (`Name, Project, NamePattern, Confidence, Loader, Detail`, highest-confidence
  first). **`CandidateVerifier` is the seam that collapses the integration-bound boot pipeline**, so
  the whole orchestration is unit-tested with fakes.

**Landmine — network vs. install:** the hardening default is `--network none`, but the *first* boot of
a given loader/MC needs network for the ServerStarterJar to download the loader + libraries. The plan
is to **pre-bake that once per `(loader, loaderVersion, minecraftVersion)`** into a cached, read-only
base tree (network only on the cache-miss), then every actual mod-boot mounts it and runs offline.
Don't wire the candidate-mod boot to run with network — that defeats the isolation.

**Host prerequisites (apply once `ContainerServerRunner` is wired into a `BootVerifier`):** the
download/resolve phase runs on the **host** (in `BootVerifier.prepareBootPack`), *not* in the boot
container, so the box running the grinder needs:
- **`CURSEFORGE_API_KEY`** env var — `clientside.supportedPlatforms()` only registers CurseForge when
  the key is present; without it CurseForge links cannot be resolved at all (Modrinth needs no key).
- **Playwright + Chromium installed** (`playwright install chromium` + OS deps, as `clientside-boot.yml`
  does) — distribution-locked CurseForge files (`allowModDistribution=false`, `downloadUrl=null`) are
  routed by `clientside.selectDownloader` to the headless-browser `BrowserDownloader`, which runs on
  the host during staging. The key and the browser are **complementary**: the key resolves the project
  and reveals the file is locked; the browser fetches the withheld jar. A locked CurseForge mod needs
  **both**. Wire the `BootVerifier` with a `BrowserDownloader()` (disposed via `use {}`) exactly as
  `VerifyClientsideCommand` does — locked-file support is then inherited, not reimplemented.

## Testing

- `ContainerServerRunnerTest` uses a fake `ContainerEngine`: no-start.sh → `NotStarted` (engine never
  called), raw output → `RunResult.Completed`, and the assembled spec carries the hardening + pack
  mount + written eula. All offline.
- `LoaderCacheTest` uses a fake `LoaderInstaller`: miss-installs-once-then-hits, failed/throwing
  install → `null` + nothing left installed, concurrent requests for one tuple install once, distinct
  tuples cached independently. All offline.
- `VerdictStoreTest`, `VerdictCsvExporterTest`, `GrinderTest` cover the orchestration with a fake
  `CandidateVerifier` (shared builders in `GrindTestFixtures.kt`): replace-not-duplicate, CSV
  escaping + confidence ordering + name-pattern column, per-loader recording, skip-already-done,
  swallow-throw, pool drains every candidate + most-popular-first. All offline.
- docker-java and the real installer have no offline doubles; `DockerJavaContainerEngine` and the
  production `LoaderInstaller` are integration-only.
- **`DockerJavaContainerEngineIT`** is the live-daemon integration test for the docker glue, **gated
  behind `GRINDER_DOCKER_IT=1`** (`@EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable`) so it is skipped on a normal /
  daemon-less CI run. Run it with a daemon + the `busybox:latest` image present:
  `docker pull busybox && GRINDER_DOCKER_IT=1 ./gradlew :serverpackcreator-grinder:test --tests "*DockerJavaContainerEngineIT"`.
  It verifies the full path (create → start → stream → ready-detect/stop → exit code → **force-remove**,
  no leaked containers) under the production hardening defaults. **Verified passing** against Docker
  29.5 on 2026-06-26.

## Still to build (the fire-and-forget service)

Done so far: the container `ServerRunner` (+ hardening seam), the `LoaderCache` pre-bake, and the
grind **orchestration** (`Grinder` + `GrindPool` + `VerdictStore` + `VerdictCsvExporter`, behind the
`CandidateVerifier` seam).

1. **Runtime image** (JRE + ServerStarterJar + entrypoint) and the real `LoaderInstaller` — a setup
   container run *with* network that snapshots the install into the `LoaderCache`.
2. **Real `CandidateVerifier`** — the integration adapter: a `ClientsideVerifier` whose
   `bootVerifierFactory` builds a `BootVerifier` over a `ContainerServerRunner`, with the `LoaderCache`
   base overlaid onto the generated pack before the offline boot. **The cache-overlay seam** (between
   `prepareBootPack` and the container run) is the one design decision left — resolve it with real
   ServerStarterJar behaviour in hand (it may need a hook in `BootVerifier`, since `ServerRunner.run`
   does not carry the loader/MC tuple). Needs the host prerequisites above (CF key + Playwright).
3. **Persistent `VerdictStore`** (file/Mongo) so a multi-day fire-and-forget run survives restarts;
   the `slug`-keyed skip + replace semantics already make resuming idempotent.
4. **Web table** over `VerdictStore.all()` + `VerdictCsvExporter`, through the existing Quasar frontend
   (QTable = sort + CSV free), not a new web stack.
