The following themes are examples to give you an idea on how to create your
own custom theme.
Said themes are:
	- BisectHosting
	- Chorb
	- Elocin
	- Kreezxil
	- ModernGamingWorld

They're people, or in the case of BisectHosting a company, which have had a noticeable impact on ServerPackCreator in a
good way. So as a little "Thank You", I've decided to add custom themes in their name.

The FormDev theme editor was used in the creation of these themes. You can get it here:
https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/theme-editor/#download

Run the downloaded JAR-file and point it towards the themes-directory. That will allow you to take a proper look at the
custom themes, along with a preview of your changes.

FormDevs documentation for customization is pretty nice. I suggest you take a thorough look at it over at:
https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/customizing/

Experiment with the existing themes, create your own and have fun!

Every .properties-file in the themes-folder will automatically be added to the list of available themes inside
ServerPackCreator. If you've added or changed a theme whilst running ServerPackCreator, you will need to restart it for
the changes to take effect.

Request for theme creations will be ignored. Please be aware that I implemented this feature so YOU can create themes.
Not in order for ME to create themes FOR you. :D

Happy theming!

Cheers,
Griefed
