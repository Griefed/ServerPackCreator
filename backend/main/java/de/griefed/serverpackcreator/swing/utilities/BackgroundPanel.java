 * It should be noted that none of the code presented here is used in any real application,  (I only do this for a hobby)
 * and therefore you use it at your own risk. Although I must admit I took about 5-10 minutes to do extensive testing, so
 * I doubt you will find many bugs :-).

 * In following the philosophy of the above quote, whenever possible, I will also attempt to provide links for related
 * reading to help you better understand the suggested solution. These readings may include tips to help solve your next
 * problem. I may include links to:
 *
 * technical articles
 * tutorials
 * the Java API
 * The Java API is huge, and we do not have time to read it from start to finish. If the examples do not solve your problem,
 * hopefully they can at least give you some ideas and introduce you to new APIs and concepts.

/**
 * Hey, Griefed here. I tried to add a tiled background image to the frame which holds the
 * JTabbedPane, but after several failed attempts, I gave up and almost threw the idea out of the
 * window. I wanted to set the background to a tiled image, because simply setting a colour seemed
 * too boring, and I needed <em>something</em> in the background so the banner icon would be more
 * clear to the eye. So, I activated my Google-Fu and encountered this holy grail of tiling images
 * for Swing.<br> Links:<br>
