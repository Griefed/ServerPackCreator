              ServerPackCreator creates a server pack from any given Forge, Fabric, Quilt, LegacyFabric and NeoForge modpack.<br>
              <br>
              Whenever you are working on an update to your modpack, you simply run ServerPackCreator and BAM! You've got yourself a
              server pack for your new modpack version.<br>

            ServerPackCreator is a passion project on which I am working in my spare time. It is also the main reason for why I got into programming in the first place.<br>
            Patience with issues and support is appreciated!<br>
            <br>
            I started getting into Java programming in February 2021, when I was working on an update for one of my Minecraft modpacks,<br>
            Survive Create Prosper 4, and got tired and bored with manually creating a server pack everytime I wanted to update and<br>
            test something, or just release a new server pack for the new modpack version.<br>
            <br>
            The thought <strong>"There must be a way to automate this, or at least make it less tedious..."</strong> was the spark which sent me off into the world of programming. And here we are.

            You are still expected to be knowledgeable about your modpack, server packs in general, server administration and managing your Java installations.<br>
            ServerPackCreator is not intended to take all the work off your shoulders!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>When using alpha, beta or in-dev version of ServerPackCreator, please keep in mind:</strong><br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Things will break with alpha releases, stuff may break when using beta releases.</li>
            <li>If you distribute server packs generated with a pre-release (alpha, beta) of ServerPackCreator, you do so at your own risk.</li>
            <li>I will not be held responsible for errors in your server pack caused by you using a pre-release.</li>
            <li>I will not be held responsible for errors in your server pack in general. <strong>Test your server packs before you ship them!</strong></li>
            <li><strong>TL;DR </strong>Don't use test to ship to prod! Test before shipping!</li>
          </ul>
