### About Pre-Releases

Do not release or publish a server pack generated using a pre-release of ServerPackCreator to your users.
If you do, and it turns out that your server pack doesn't work because of a bug in ServerPackCreator, that's on you for using a pre-release.

When using pre-release installers, make sure to uninstall the previous pre-release first. Otherwise, the installers
own version checks may trigger an error out of my control. After uninstalling, install the newly downloaded one and
you're good to go.

Only use the installers if you are versed in system-administration, manually editing and removing services, editing registries,
so on and so forth.

#### Alphas

Alphas are feature-incomplete and very likely to have bugs. Consider them broken by default. Use at your own risk!

#### Betas

Betas are feature-complete and probably have bugs. Additional features *may* be added during the beta-phase of any given release, though.
