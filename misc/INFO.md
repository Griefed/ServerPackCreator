### Additional Installer-Notes

It is recommended to have administration-privileges when using the Windows and macOS installers.
I am not a member of the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) and won't pay for codesign-certificates, therefor installers are unsigned.
Running a given installer may produce warnings depending on what OS you are using. You may choose to install it anyway, please be aware though that doing so is, in general, not a safe practice. For ServerPackCreator, though, it is unfortunately the only way to run the installer.

### macOS PKG

MacOS will complain about potential security risks and refuse to install and run ServerPackCreator. To circumvent this, please see the official guides depending on your version of macOS: [Ventura](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac), [Monterey](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/12.0/mac/12.0).

### Windows EXE

Hit "More information" if the Windows SmartScreen-message pops up. Afterward, a button will appear which will let you run the installer anyway.
