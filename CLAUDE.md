## What is ServerPackCreator?

ServerPackCreator creates a server pack from any given Forge, Fabric, Quilt, LegacyFabric and
NeoForge Minecraft-modpack.

It is a Kotlin application and API: the API lives in `serverpackcreator-api`, the application in
`serverpackcreator-app`, the SPA in `serverpackcreator-web-frontend`.

---

## Module map

Gradle multi-project build (`settings.gradle.kts`), Kotlin 2.3.x, JVM 21, version catalog in
`libs.versions.toml`, convention plugins in
`buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/serverpackcreator.*-conventions.gradle.kts`.

Each in-build module has its own `CLAUDE.md` with the details — the entries below are the map only.

- **serverpackcreator-api** — core library, published to Maven Central. Packages: `config`,
  `serverpack`, `modscanning`, `versionmeta`, `plugins` (pf4j API), `utilities`, plus `ApiWrapper`
  (composition root), `ApiProperties`, `ApiPlugins`. **Plugins compile against this module — its
  public surface is a compatibility constraint.** See `serverpackcreator-api/CLAUDE.md`.
- **serverpackcreator-clientside** — the clientside-mod verification engine (platforms, metadata +
  server-boot signals, downloaders, fallback-list editor). Depends only on `-api`; **not** published
  to Maven, so it churns freely. Reused by the app's CLI verbs and the planned grinder service. See
  `serverpackcreator-clientside/CLAUDE.md`.
- **serverpackcreator-app** — four apps in one module under `de.griefed.serverpackcreator.app`:
  `cli`, `gui` (Swing), `web` (Spring Boot 4 backend), `updater`. Entry point `ServerPackCreator.kt`
    + `Mode.kt`. See `serverpackcreator-app/CLAUDE.md`.
- **serverpackcreator-plugin-example** — pf4j example plugin exercising every extension point.
  Documentation-by-example: must always reflect current API idiom. See
  `serverpackcreator-plugin-example/CLAUDE.md`.
- **serverpackcreator-web-frontend** — Quasar 2 / Vue 3 SPA, JavaScript (TS migration planned),
  Pinia stores, built into the app's web backend via the org.siouan frontend Gradle plugin. See
  `serverpackcreator-web-frontend/CLAUDE.md`.
- **serverpackcreator-grinder** — standalone fire-and-forget service that boot-verifies mods at scale
  in isolated, network-less **Docker containers** (docker-java). Depends on `-clientside` (+ `-api`);
  no Spring/Swing; not published. Foundation stage: the container-backed `ServerRunner`. See
  `serverpackcreator-grinder/CLAUDE.md`.
- Not in the Gradle build: `serverpackcreator-help` (docs), `buildSrc`, `docker`, `misc`.

## Build & test commands

- `./gradlew build` — full build. The app build depends on the frontend build and license report.
- `./gradlew :serverpackcreator-api:test` — API suite (runs against fixture modpacks in
  `serverpackcreator-api/tests/` and `src/test/resources/testresources/`; no live network needed).
- `./gradlew :serverpackcreator-app:test` — app suite.
- `./gradlew :<module>:koverHtmlReport` / `koverXmlReport` — coverage (Kover), report under
  `<module>/build/reports/kover/`.
- Frontend: `npm install && npx quasar dev` in `serverpackcreator-web-frontend/` (dev server),
  `npx quasar build` for production build, `npm test` (Vitest).
- Run the app locally: `./gradlew :serverpackcreator-app:run` (GUI by default; CLI/web via args,
  see `Mode.kt` / `CommandlineParser.kt`).
- `media` task needs install4j installed locally — not part of regular dev loop.

## Branching & git workflow

- PRs target **`develop`**; `main` is the release branch.
- One branch per feature/fix, prefixed `claude-` when created by Claude. Group related fixes.
- **Never push. Keep all changes local — the user pushes.**

## API compatibility policy (adopted default — Griefed may override)

- The plugin-facing API (everything `serverpackcreator-api` exports, esp. `plugins`,
  `ApiWrapper`, `PackConfig`) stays source-compatible within a major version.
- Refactors keep old entry points as thin deprecated facades (`@Deprecated` with `ReplaceWith`)
  for at least one major release before removal.
- Internal-only types may move/change freely once they are no longer exported.

---

## Conventions

- **KISS + MVC + TDD + SOLID** — always.
- **No shortcuts:** fix bugs when found, don't defer.
- **No assumptions:** read the code, check the docs before advising.
- **git:** never push yourself; let the user push. One branch per feature/fix; group related work;
  prefix Claude-created branches with `claude-`.

### Module boundaries (architecture — SOLID / MVC)

- `serverpackcreator-api` is the domain core. It must **not** gain compile dependencies on Swing,
  Spring web, or the web frontend. Dependencies point inward toward `-api`, never outward; the app
  and frontend are adapters around it. Flag any inward-pointing violation.
- Domain logic in `-api` must be unit-testable **without** booting a Spring context. A class that
  needs the Spring container to be tested is a design smell — flag it.
- (Plugin-API stability is governed by the **API compatibility policy** above — don't duplicate it.)

### Refactor discipline (behavior-preserving by default)

- One logical concern per commit. Keep "add tests", "pure refactor (no behavior change)", and
  "change behavior" in **separate** commits. Related behavior changes may be grouped.
- Pin current behavior with characterization tests **before** restructuring legacy code; refactor
  in small steps behind source-compatible facades (Strangler-Fig), keep the suite green at every
  commit.
- A pure-refactor commit must keep the **existing** assertions green. If a test must change for a
  "refactor", that's a signal the change is **not** behavior-preserving — stop and flag it.
- Boy-Scout rule: leave touched files cleaner than you found them, but stay within the commit's
  stated scope; don't let cleanup sprawl into unrelated files.

### Kotlin idioms

- Prefer `val` over `var`; immutable data by default.
- `data class` for value types, `sealed class` + exhaustive `when` for state, Kotlin null-safety
  instead of defensive null checks. Don't port Java patterns 1:1.
- No **new** `!!` non-null assertions in refactored code — handle nullability explicitly.
- **Naming — speaking names:** variables, parameters, constants, types and methods get names a
  reader can derive meaning and context from (`configRepo`, `attemptCount`, `tokenOverridesJSON`),
  not single letters. The one carve-out is the throwaway loop counter; it generalises only to a
  small, closed set of established Kotlin idioms whose meaning is universal and whose scope is a few
  lines. The line is "would a newcomer have to scroll up to learn what this is?" — if yes, name it.
- **Documentation — comment everything:** every function, method and exported constant carries a
  doc comment — unexported ones too. State briefly WHAT it's for and HOW it achieves it, not a
  restatement of the signature. One or two sentences is the target; needing more is a sign the unit
  is doing too much (KISS). Keep comments truthful as code changes — a stale comment is worse than
  none.
- **Errors:** always handle, never ignore with `_` unless intentional (comment why).

## Definition of done (per change)

1. Tests written first and green (`./gradlew :<module>:test`).
2. Doc comments per **## Conventions** on every new/changed unit.
3. No new compiler warnings; stale comments updated.
4. CLAUDE.md "Refactor state" (and the relevant module `CLAUDE.md`) updated when an architectural
   step lands. Append the blow-by-blow to `claude-docs/REFACTOR-LOG.md`, not here.

## Refactor state (living — current snapshot only; full history in `claude-docs/REFACTOR-LOG.md`)

**Goal:** KISS/MVC/TDD/SOLID across api → app → plugin-example → web-frontend.
**Phases:** 0 baseline · 1 API · 2 app · 3 plugin-example · 4 frontend.

**Current status (2026-06-26):**

| Module         | Tests         | Notes                                                                                |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| api            | 163 (from 75) | Phase 1 **complete**; + `MinecraftMetaTest` characterizing `requiredJavaVersion`      |
| clientside     | 53            | Extracted from `-app`; `BootVerifier` split + `packPostProcessor` hook; selection (MC-support gate) + setup-abort classification pinned |
| app            | 71            | Phase 2 largely complete; clientside engine extracted out, CLI verbs stay             |
| plugin-example | 3 (from 0)    | Phase 3 **complete**                                                                  |
| web-frontend   | 23 (from 0)   | Phase 4a–4e done: Vitest, `$q` decoupling, **full TS migration**, component coverage  |
| grinder        | 50 (+IT)      | Core loop **e2e-verified on current MC** (26.2/Quilt boots offline on JDK 25); **continuous fire-and-forget** mode with stale-verdict re-verification; container/loader/report/source subpackages; MC selection bounded to image-supported Java (`ImageJavaRuntimes`) |

Key size reductions (all behind source-compatible facades): `ApiProperties.kt` 3,007 → 1,372;
`ConfigurationHandler.kt` 1,562 → 897; `ServerPackHandler.kt` 1,466 → 490.

**Remaining hotspots:** `ConfigEditor.kt` 1,369 — assessed: the two pure pieces (dirty-check,
Java-version) are extracted; the rest is legitimate Swing view code, not worth mechanically
splitting. `LarsonScanner.kt` 2,217 — self-contained widget, low priority.

**Open issues (details + locations in the relevant module `CLAUDE.md`):**
The GUI `GlobalScope.launch` anti-pattern (app) is **resolved** — all 26 sites now use
`gui.utilities.ComponentCoroutineScope` (lifecycle-cancelled), GUI-verified. The frontend's
settings-store `$q` coupling (4b) and `jsconfig.json`/TS gap (4c) are **resolved**.

**Current phase — 4 (frontend) complete; GUI structured-concurrency done.** Frontend 4a–4e: Vitest,
settings-store `$q` decoupling, full TypeScript migration (all `src/` is TS, verified by
`quasar build`), a Quasar component test harness (Vue Test Utils), and broadened component coverage
(all cards + nav SFCs; suite at 23; tables left untested by design — trivial format-lambda logic vs.
brittle QTable rendering). The GUI `GlobalScope.launch` anti-pattern is resolved (see Open issues),
GUI-verified. **Next (optional):** broaden component-test coverage further.
