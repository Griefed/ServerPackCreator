How to use ServerPackCreator:

 java -jar ServerPackCreator.jar
   Simply running the JAR without extra arguments runs ServerPackCreator in GUI mode unless
   you are running in a headless environment. In the case of a headless environment, the CLI
   mode will automatically be used.

 Extra arguments to use ServerPackCreator with: #
      -lang: Allows you to use one of the available languages for ServerPackCreator. I can not
             guarantee that each of the following available languages is 100% translated.
             You best choice is en_us, or not specifying any as that is the default, because
             I write ServerPackCreator with english in mind. Available usages:
             -lang en_us
             -lang uk_ua
             -lang de_de

      -cgen: Only available for the commandline interface. This will start the generation of
             a new configuration file. You will be asked to enter information about your modpack
             step-by-step. Each setting you enter will be checked for errors before it is saved.
             If everything you enter is valid and without errors, it will be written to a new
             serverpackcreator.conf and ServerPackCreator will immediately start a run with said
             configuration file, generating a server pack for you.

    -update: Check whether a new version of ServerPackCreator is available for download.
             If an update is available, the version and link to the release of said update are
             written to the console so you can from work with it from there.
             Note: Automatic updates are currently not planned nor supported, and neither are
             downloads of any available updates to your system. You need to update manually.

       -cli: Run ServerPackCreator in Command-line interface mode. Checks the serverpackcreator.conf
             for errors and if none are found, starts the generation of a server pack with the configuration
             provided by your serverpackcreator.conf.

       -web: Run ServerPackCreator as a webservice available at http://localhost:8080. The webservice
             provides the same functionality as running ServerPackCreator in GUI mode (so no Commandline
             arguments and a non-headless environment) as well as a REST API which can be used in different ways.
             For more information about the REST API, please see the Java documentation:
              - GitHub Pages: https://griefed.github.io/ServerPackCreator/
              - GitLab Pages: https://griefed.pages.griefed.de/ServerPackCreator/

       -gui: Run ServerPackCreator using the graphical user interface. If your environment supports
             graphics, i.e. is not headless, then this is the default mode in which ServerPackCreator
             started as when no arguments are used.

    --setup: Set up and prepare the environment for subsequent runs of ServerPackCreator.
             This will create/copy all files needed for ServerPackCreator to function
             properly from inside its JAR-file and setup everything else, too.
