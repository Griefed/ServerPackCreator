    .SYNOPSIS

    Download and install Java with the version required by the Minecraft server.

    .DESCRIPTION

    Download and install Java with the version required by the Minecraft version set in the variables.txt which was
    also shipped with this modpack. Should you want to use a different Java version with your server pack, change
    the RECOMMENDED_JAVA_VERSION. Likewise, you can change the vendor of the JDK to another one by changing
    JDK_VENDOR in your variables.txt

    Depending on which Minecraft version is used in this server pack, a different Java version may be installed.

    ATTENTION:
       This script will NOT modify the JAVA_HOME variable for your user.

    A list of available JDK versions and vendors can be found at https://github.com/Jabba-Team/index/blob/main/index.json
    Jabba is available at https://github.com/Jabba-Team/jabba
