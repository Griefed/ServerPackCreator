/**
 * A FileInclusionSpecification is at minimum a source-declaration from which files and directories will be included
 * in the server pack to be generated.
 *
 * Optionally, the following values can be specified:
 * * Destination
 * * Inclusion-filter (regex)
 * * Exclusion-filter (regex)
 *
 * * When a destination is specified, then every file and directory acquired from the source will be copied to the
 * specified destination in the server pack, whereas otherwise the source would be copied to a destination in the server
 * pack matching the name of the source.
 * * Inclusion filters help to further limit the files and directories to be included from the specified source. Any file
 * and directory matching this filter will be included.
 * * Exclusion filters help to further limit the files and directories to be included from the specified source. Any file
 * and directory matching this filter will NOT be included.
