/**
 * Everything revolving around creating a server pack. The intended workflow is to create a [PackConfig] and run
 * it through any of the available [ConfigurationHandler.checkConfiguration]-variants, and then call [run] with the
 * previously checked configuration model. You may run with an unchecked configuration model, but no guarantees or
 * promises, yes not even support, is given for running a model without checking it first.
 *
 * This class also gives you access to the methods which are responsible for creating the server pack, in case you want
 * to do things manually.
 *
 * If you want to execute extensions, see
 * * [ApiPlugins.runPreGenExtensions]},
 * * [ApiPlugins.runPreZipExtensions]} and
 * * [ApiPlugins.runPostGenExtensions].
 *
 * @param apiProperties Base settings of ServerPackCreator needed for server pack generation, such as access to the
 * directories, script templates and so on.
 * @param versionMeta   Meta for modloader and version specific checks and information gathering, such as modloader
 * installer downloads.
 * @param utilities     Common utilities used across ServerPackCreator.
 * @param apiPlugins    Any addons which a user may want to execute during the generation of a server pack.
 * @param modScanner    In case a user enabled automatic sideness detection, this will exclude clientside-only mods
 * from a server pack.
