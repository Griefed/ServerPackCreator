     * This method gets called when an extension of this type is run. All parameters are provided by
     * ServerPackCreator, so you do not have to take care of them. A ConfigPanel is intended to be
     * used to change server pack-specific configurations which can then be used by other extensions
     * in your plugin. A simple example would be downloading a specific version of some mod. You could
     * add a panel which lets the user configure the version of the mod to use. When the user then
     * runs the server pack generation, your setting will be stored in the subsequently generated
     * serverpackcreator.conf, and could be used in any of the
     * [de.griefed.serverpackcreator.api.ServerPackHandler] extension-points, which would then
     * download the version you specified via this here panel.
     *
     * @param versionMeta           Instance of [VersionMeta] so you can work with available Minecraft, Forge, Fabric,
     * LegacyFabric and Quilt versions.
     * @param apiProperties Instance of [ApiProperties] The current configuration of ServerPackCreator,
     * like the default list of clientside-only mods, the server pack directory etc.
     * @param utilities             Instance of [Utilities] commonly used across ServerPackCreator.
     * @param serverPackConfigTab   Instance of a class implementing [ServerPackConfigTab] to give you access to the
     * various fields inside it, like the modpack directory, selected
     * Minecraft, modloader and modloader versions, etc.
     * @param pluginConfig           Plugin specific configuration conveniently provided by ServerPackCreator. This is
     * the global configuration of the plugin which provides the ConfigPanelExtension to ServerPackCreator.
     * @param extensionName         The name the titled border of this ConfigPanel will get.
     * @param pluginID              The same as the PluginId.
     * @return A ConfigPanel allowing users to further customize their ServerPackCreator experience
     * when using a plugin.
